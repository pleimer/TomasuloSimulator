# TomasuloSimulator
Simulator of the tomasulo architecture implemented in C++ - provides detailed information on the 
step by step out of order execution of the architecture and reports final results of an assembly program. 

To run simulation, make then execute files in the testcases folder. Assembly code executed from .asm files in asm folder (it is fine to
write new assembly programs).
Note: timing reports are only accurate for the first two testcase files. Later ones use features of the architecture that were 
never fully implemented.
